  kairos-mcp maintainer umbrella (developer-scoped, internal). Loads the
  Docker Compose full-stack development environment plus every maintainer
  workflow for this repository: build/deploy/test, MCP end-to-end QA, bug
  fix-to-ship, semver releases, UI/UX specs, git editor-safe commands, git
  worktree index repair, worktree .env handling, documentation governance,
  and MCP host-bridge server selection. Trigger when working ON the
  kairos-mcp codebase as a developer/maintainer: running the dev stack,
  building, testing, releasing, fixing defects, or auditing docs. Not for
  end users — the user-facing skill is `kairos`. Each workflow lives in a
  reference under references/; read the one that matches the task.

# KAIROS — Developer / Maintainer Umbrella

**Developer-scoped, internal.** This skill is for maintainers working **on**
the kairos-mcp repository. End users never need it — they use the `kairos`
skill. `metadata.internal: true` keeps it out of user-facing
`npx skills add` listings while cloned-repo agent hosts still auto-load it
from `.agents/skills/`.

Everything a maintainer needs is split into focused references. Read the one
that matches your task; do not paste their content elsewhere (single source of
truth).

## Development environment (Docker Compose full stack)

For anything beyond the end-user npx path, run the repository the way CI does:
Docker Compose full stack via npm scripts.

- **[dev-environment.md](references/dev-environment.md)** — spin up the local
  full stack (`npm ci`, `npm run infra:up`, `dev:deploy`), ports, and how it
  maps to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/jakub-plichcinski/kairos-mcp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **[build-test.md](references/build-test.md)** — the authoritative build /
  deploy / test contract: npm scripts only, always `dev:deploy` before
  `dev:test`. Read this before running any test.

## Repo Wiki publishing (no skill)

Publishing `.qoder/repowiki/en/content/` to the GitHub Wiki is **not** a manual
skill. Qoder regenerates the RepoWiki, and the
[`sync-qoder-repowiki-to-github-wiki`](https://github.com/jakub-plichcinski/kairos-mcp/blob/main/.github/workflows/sync-qoder-repowiki-to-github-wiki.yml)
workflow runs [`scripts/sync-wiki.sh`](https://github.com/jakub-plichcinski/kairos-mcp/blob/main/scripts/sync-wiki.sh)
on push to `main`. See [doc-governance.md](references/doc-governance.md).
